# Dijstra-s-Algorithm

The single source shortest path algorithm is dijkstras algorithm.
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.road networks.
The code for its implementation is provided.

##time complexities of algorithm

Time Complexity of the implementation is O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, it can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
